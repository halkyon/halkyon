I'm a generalist software and infrastructure engineer, with specific interests in containerisation, Kubernetes 🚢☸️, configuration as code 📝, and cloud architectures ☁️.

Previously I worked on open source [Silverstripe CMS/framework](https://github.com/silverstripe), and [Silverstripe Cloud](https://www.silverstripe.com/cloud-hosting/) platform-as-a-service.
